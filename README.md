## Project Overview
This is a command-line interface (CLI) Quiz developed in Java. Its primary purpose is to ask the user **multiple-choice questions** and **evaluate their answers** to determine a final score. This project serves as a practical application of fundamental Java concepts, including object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like **encapsulation**, **classes**, and **methods**.
